## List of Sorting Algorithms

The repository includes the following sorting algorithms:

1. Bubble sort - implemented by Aman Goel (source: [Bubble Sort in C](https://hackr.io/blog/bubble-sort-in-c))
2. Insertion sort - implemented by N/A (source: [Insertion Sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/insertion-sort))
3. Selection sort - implemented by N/A (source: [Selection Sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/selection-sort))
4. Merge sort - implemented by N/A (source: [Merge Sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/merge-sort))
5. Shell sort - implemented by N/A (source: [Shell Sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/shell-sort))
6. Quick sort - implemented by Akhil Bhadwal (source: [Quick Sort in C](https://hackr.io/blog/quick-sort-in-c))

## Comparison Table

The following table provides the average machine execution time (in milliseconds) for each sorting algorithm at different input sizes:

| Size [Equation] | Bubble | Insertion | Selection | Merge | Shell | Quick |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4096 | 12.0000 | 15.0000 | 0.0000 | 1.5000 | 0.0000 |
| 8192 | 47.7000 | 80.9000 | 0.0000 | 1.5000 | 1.5000 |
| 16384 | 184.0000 | 305.7000 | 3.0000 | 7.5000 | 1.5000 |
| 32798 | 712.2000 | 1174.6000 | 7.5000 | 13.5000 | 4.5000 |
| 65536 | 2946.5000 | 4829.4000 | 9.0000 | 43.1000 | 10.5000 |
